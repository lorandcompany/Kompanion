How It Works
============
The Kompanion primarily works with links and broadcast formulas `br()`. These are pretty basic and will require not a lot of prior knowledge as long as you read the requirements properly.

Error Handling
==============

You might miss a variable or two while implementing Kompanion to your themes. This is where error handling comes in. If there is something missing with the link, a window pops up indicating what the error is. This would give you enough information to understand what went wrong and fix it in an efficient manner.

If you’re having a hard time understanding the problem, take a screenshot of the window and post in the Discord server and someone might be able to help you with your predicament. Don’t rely on them too much though as they are not required to help you. Just do this as a last resort.

Version Compatibility
=====================

Lower version of Kompanion might not support some of the features indicated in the reference. I suggest you update your Kompanion app to the latest version. I won’t be catering problems when the app is not in its latest version as this will cause additional problems on my side.
